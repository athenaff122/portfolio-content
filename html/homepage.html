	<h3>
		During the tour, we should enjoy the local food and give yourself a relax.

	<h3>
		Traveling to Spain means for me getting familiar with the food culture of Spain: eating traditional Spanish food, sampling traditional dishes from Spain, and drinking typical Spanish drinks.
Tasting local food in Spain and trying regional Spanish cuisines were on my list of things to do in Spain.
