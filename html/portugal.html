		Introduction of Portugal
	</h2>
	<h3>
		Once capital of one of the largest empires in the world, Portugal packs great variety for its size. In a few days' drive, you can go from the wide Douro valley, layered with port wine vineyards, to hilly Porto with its Roman roots, through laid-back Lisbon and UNESCO-protected Evora to sunny Algarve's beach resorts backed by craggy rocks.
